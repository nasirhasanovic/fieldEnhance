# fieldEnhance
Test for field code.
Tech: Swiftiui + core data

Note: tried to keep it simple, no external libs were used.

App is pretty simple, if you are online when adding new todo it will send request to perform it, if not it will create it and store it locally, as for all actions, if network is available it will try and communicate with server if not changes will be saved locally anyway.
